You must use Unity 2019.4 LTS or later for this project. You will be using Unity’s ShaderGraph tool to create different shaders and effects. You are not expected to exactly replicate the examples given – you have the creative freedom to design your shaders to look cartoon-y, realistic, pixelated, etc., but a non-technical person must be able to look at your shader example and recognize it as glowing or as water, etc.

ShaderGraph has the benefit of being a visual tool so that you can see exactly how each node, property, and mathematical function affects your shader. In order to fully take advantage of ShaderGraph’s capabilities, you must familiarize yourself with the functions of its nodes.

This project will be different in that you will not be required to provide a build as the last task. Instead, you will be exporting an Asset package containing your shaders. For each task’s manual review, your shaders will be applied to different GameObjects and evaluated on their appearance and performance.

What you should learn
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is rendering
What is a render pipeline
What is Unity’s Scriptable Render Pipeline
What is a shader
What is ShaderGraph and how is it used
How to setup a new project that utilizes ShaderGraph
What is the difference between surface, vertex and fragment shaders
What is UV mapping
What is vertex animation
Requirements for Unity projects
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project

Tasks
0. Glow up
mandatory
Create a new project called 0x0D-unity-shadergraph. In the Package Manager, enable the Universal Render Pipeline. Create a new Universal Render Pipeline Asset and drop it into your project’s Graphics settings. This will enable you to utilize ShaderGraph.

Create a material and shader that makes an untextured 3D GameObject glow around the edges.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Base color
Glow color
Glow strength
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.



Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-unity
Directory: 0x0D-unity-shadergraph
File: glow.shadergraph, glow.mat
 
1. Pulse
mandatory
Based on the previous shader, create a new shader where the glow pulses / fades in and out.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Base color
Glow color
Minimum glow strength
Maximum glow strength
Pulse frequency
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.



Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-unity
Directory: 0x0D-unity-shadergraph
File: glow_animated.shadergraph, glow_animated.mat
 
2. Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good
mandatory
Create a shader that simulates a disintegrating or dissolving effect.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Base color
Disintegration / dissolving speed
Scale of disintegrating fragments
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.



Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-unity
Directory: 0x0D-unity-shadergraph
File: disintegrate.shadergraph, disintegrate.mat
 
3. Iceman
mandatory
Create a shader that makes an object look like ice. The object should be partially transparent.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Base color
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.

4. Hey Cortana, what's UV positioning?
mandatory
Create a shader that applies a flickering hologram effect to an object. You must use a Texture in this shader.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Base color
Texture
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.

5. Sine of the sea
mandatory
Create an animated shader that simulates the appearance of water.

You must be able to change the following properties of the shader in the Inspector window:

Color(s)
Wave size
Wave frequency
You are not limited to having only these properties, you may have as many properties and nodes as you need to achieve the effect.



Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-unity
Directory: 0x0D-unity-shadergraph
File: water.shadergraph, water.mat
 
6. Same day delivery
mandatory
Export all your shaders into an Asset Package.

Your package hierarchy should look like this:

Materials
glow.mat
glow_animated.mat
etc.
Shaders
glow.shader
glow_animated.shader
etc.
Textures
<Texture Files>
Your package should not contain any extra files, scenes, or dependencies, only the shader and material files.

Name the package 0x0D-unity-shaders. Upload it to Dropbox or Google Drive and provide the link below:
