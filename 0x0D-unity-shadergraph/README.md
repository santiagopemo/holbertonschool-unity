## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* What is rendering
* What is a render pipeline
* What is Unity’s Scriptable Render Pipeline
* What is a shader
* What is ShaderGraph and how is it used
* How to setup a new project that utilizes ShaderGraph
* What is the difference between surface, vertex and fragment shaders
* What is UV mapping
* What is vertex animation
* Requirements for Unity projects
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your holbertonschool-unity directory
* Push the entire project folder 0x0D-unity-shaders to your repo

## Tasks
### Mandatory :page_with_curl:
- [x] **[0. Glow up](./glow.shadergraph)** - Create a new project called 0x0D-unity-shadergraph. In the Package Manager, enable the Universal Render Pipeline. Create a new Universal Render Pipeline Asset and drop it into your project’s Graphics settings. This will enable you to utilize ShaderGraph
- [x] **[1. Pulse](./glow_animated.shadergraph)** - Based on the previous shader, create a new shader where the glow pulses / fades in and out
- [x] **[2. Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good](./disintegrate.shadergraph)** - Create a shader that simulates a disintegrating or dissolving effect
- [x] **[3. Iceman](./ice.shadergraph)** - Create a shader that makes an object look like ice. The object should be partially transparent
- [x] **[4. Hey Cortana, what's UV positioning?](./hologram.shadergraph)** - Create a shader that applies a flickering hologram effect to an object. You must use a Texture in this shader
- [x] **[5. Sine of the sea](./water.shadergraph)** - Create an animated shader that simulates the appearance of water
- [x] **[6. Same day delivery](./0x0D-unity-shaders.unitypackage)** - Export all your shaders into an Asset Package
